                HTML Language
                Purpose: HTML is used to structure content on the web. It defines elements like headings, paragraphs, links, images, and more, allowing browsers to render web pages. HTML was created by Tim Berners-Lee in 1991 while he was working at CERN. He developed it as part of the framework for the World Wide Web.
                First Specification: The first formal specification was published in 1995, known as HTML 2.0.</p>
